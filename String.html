    <p>Strings are used to store sequences of characters.</p>
    <li>Is a string a data type?</li>
    <p>A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.</p>
    <li>Why is text called a string?</li>
    <p>Text is also called a string because it consists of a sequence of characters like a string.</p>
    <li>What are characters in a string?</li>
    <p>Each digit in a string is a character, and a character is a single visual object used to represent text, numbers, or symbols.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>After the discussion, we concluded that Strings are a simple method to store some textual information, and Strings are an array of characters that terminate with a null character '\0'. The difference between a character array and a string is that, unlike the character array, the string ends with a null character. Apart from this, we have also discussed top theoretical interview questions as well as the top 50 interview coding questions on strings, which will help you tackle interview problems.</p>
