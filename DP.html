        <h2>What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?</h2>
        <p>
            Dynamic Programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. DP algorithms efficiently solve problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. By storing the results of subproblems in a table, DP avoids redundant calculations and improves computational efficiency.

        <h2>Top 10 Dynamic Programming Interview Questions and Answers</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>What is Dynamic Programming (DP)?</h3>
                <p>Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking a complex problem into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, saving the solutions to avoid redundant work. It's particularly useful for optimization problems.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What are the two main properties that a problem must exhibit to be eligible for a dynamic programming solution?</h3>
                <p>A problem must have both optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems. Optimal substructure means that an optimal solution to the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. Overlapping subproblems indicate that the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved independently, but the solutions to these subproblems are reused multiple times.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What's the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches in dynamic programming?</h3>
                <p>Top-down, or memoization, starts from the initial problem and divides it into smaller subproblems, recursively solving each subproblem. It stores the solutions to subproblems in memory to avoid redundant calculations. Bottom-up, or tabulation, begins with the smallest subproblems and builds up to the original problem, avoiding recursion. Both approaches achieve the same result.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What is the Fibonacci sequence, and how can dynamic programming be used to find its nth term?</h3>
                <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. To find the nth term using dynamic programming, we can use an array to store values from 0 to n and iteratively calculate each term based on the previous two terms.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>Explain the concept of memoization.</h3>
                <p>Memoization is an optimization technique used in dynamic programming. It involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. Memoization avoids redundant calculations and improves the efficiency of recursive algorithms.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What is the time complexity of a dynamic programming algorithm?</h3>
                <p>The time complexity of a dynamic programming algorithm depends on the specific problem and approach used. Typically, it ranges from O(n) to O(n^2) or even higher. Problems with nested loops tend to have higher time complexity.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What is the "Knapsack Problem," and how is it solved using dynamic programming?</h3>
                <p>The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where you have a set of items, each with a weight and a value. The goal is to determine the most valuable combination of items that fit into a knapsack with a limited weight capacity. Dynamic programming can be used to find the optimal solution by considering two choices for each item: including it or excluding it from the knapsack, depending on whether the total weight exceeds the capacity.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What are some common mistakes to avoid when implementing dynamic programming algorithms?</h3>
                <p>Common mistakes include not defining base cases correctly, failing to identify overlapping subproblems, using incorrect recurrence relations, and not implementing an efficient approach to tabulation or memoization. Careful consideration of the problem and thorough testing are essential for successful dynamic programming solutions.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>What are the advantages of using dynamic programming over other problem-solving techniques?</h3>
                <p>Dynamic programming offers advantages such as improved time complexity, a structured approach to problem-solving, guaranteed optimality in solutions, and the ability to solve complex problems efficiently. It's particularly useful for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.</p>
            </li>
        
            <li>
                <h3>Give an example of a real-world problem that can be solved using dynamic programming.</h3>
                <p>A classic real-world problem is finding the shortest path in a weighted graph, such as using Dijkstra's algorithm for single-source shortest paths. Dynamic programming is used to compute the shortest path efficiently and is applicable in scenarios like navigation, network routing, and logistics optimization.</p>
